The number "128000" that you are seeing in relation to an audio file with a duration of 3 minutes and 19 seconds is likely the bitrate of the audio file. In audio encoding, bitrate refers to the amount of data (in bits) processed or transmitted per unit of time (usually measured in kilobits per second, or kbps).

A bitrate of 128,000 bits per second (128 kbps) is a common bitrate for audio files, especially for MP3 format files. This bitrate represents the amount of data used to encode the audio per second of playback. Higher bitrates generally result in higher audio quality but also larger file sizes, while lower bitrates result in lower audio quality and smaller file sizes.

So, if your audio file has a duration of 3 minutes and 19 seconds, and it's encoded at a bitrate of 128 kbps, you can calculate the approximate file size using the following formula:

File Size (in kilobytes) = (Bitrate in kbps / 8) * Duration (in seconds)

File Size (in kilobytes) = (128 kbps / 8) * ((3 minutes * 60 seconds/minute) + 19 seconds)

File Size ≈ (16 KB/s) * (199 seconds) ≈ 3184 kilobytes ≈ 3.1 megabytes

So, with a bitrate of 128 kbps, an audio file with a duration of 3 minutes and 19 seconds would be approximately 3.1 megabytes in size. This is a rough estimate, and the actual file size may vary depending on factors like encoding settings and audio compression.
